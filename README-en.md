# Project-6

## Project description
On this project I'm working as an analyst at Zuber, a new ride-sharing company launching in Chicago. My task is to find patterns in the available information. I want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.  
Working with a database, i will analyze competitor data and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on travel frequency.

## Data description

Note: This project was developed based on the guidance I received to improve my logical reasoning as a student. As a result, we even maintain all requested orders related to guidance for carrying out the necessary calculations.
